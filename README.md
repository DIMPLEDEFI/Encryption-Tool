## Introduction

The Encryption Tool is a command-line utility designed to encrypt and decrypt files using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption algorithm. It provides a secure and efficient way to protect your sensitive data. This tool was created for use in a terminal environment and focuses on security and ease of use.

## Features

- **AES Encryption**: Utilizes the AES encryption algorithm for secure data protection.
- **File Compression**: Optional file compression to reduce file size before encryption.
- **Password-Based Encryption**: Encrypt and decrypt files using a passphrase.
- **File Integrity Checks**: Ensures the integrity of encrypted and decrypted files.
- **HMAC Verification**: Uses HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) for data integrity verification.
- **Network Isolation**: Operates in a network-isolated mode to prevent unintentional network access.
- **Secure Clipboard Handling**: Clears clipboard data to prevent leakage of sensitive information.
- **Logging**: Logs events and errors for auditing and troubleshooting.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `pycryptodome` library (`pip install pycryptodome`)
- `tqdm` library (`pip install tqdm`)

## Installation

1. Clone or download the Encryption Tool repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/yourusername/encryption-tool).

2. Install the required Python libraries using pip:
   ```
   pip install pycryptodome tqdm
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

1. Open your terminal.

2. Navigate to the directory where the Encryption Tool is located.

3. Run the tool:
   ```
   python encryption_tool.py
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to encrypt or decrypt a file.

### Advanced Options

- **Passphrase Strength**: Ensure your passphrase is strong. It should contain at least 8 characters, including uppercase, lowercase, and a digit.

- **File Compression**: You can enable or disable file compression during the encryption process.

- **Chunk Size**: Specify the chunk size for file I/O. The default is 65536 bytes, but you can adjust it for performance optimization.

## FAQs

**Q: How can I reset my encryption key or passphrase?**

A: Unfortunately, once data is encrypted with a passphrase, it cannot be decrypted without that exact passphrase. There is no "reset" option. Make sure to remember your passphrase or key.

**Q: Is there a way to use this tool with a graphical user interface (GUI)?**

A: Currently, the Encryption Tool is a command-line utility. However, you can explore GUI frameworks like Tkinter to build a graphical interface on top of it.

**Q: How do I know if my file has been tampered with during decryption?**

A: The tool uses HMAC for data integrity verification. If the integrity check fails during decryption, it means the file has been tampered with, and you should not trust its content.
